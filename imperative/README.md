# Imperative Programming Paradigm

## Introduction

In this practice, we will experience the benefits and drawbacks of [Imperative Programming Paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) using `C++`.

## Tasks

1. Change working directory to `imperative`.
   
   ```sh
   cd imperative
   ```

2. Build the project using the `make` commands.
   
   ```sh
   make clean
   make
   ```

3. Add a new pokemon type `Bulbasaur` which has 30 HP and 2 ATK. It takes 1 less damage on every hit and has a special attack `VineWhip` which deals 5 damage.
   
4. Modify `main.cpp` and test the new pokemon.
   
5. Evaluate the changes required to add a number of new pokemons in the future.


## Next step

Move on to the [object_oriented](../object_oriented) folder and follow the instruction there to add and modify Pokemons in an object-oriented way.
