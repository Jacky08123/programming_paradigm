# Declaractive Programming Paradigm

## Introduction

In this practice, we will modify and run a [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) program to get a taste of the [Declarative Programming Paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming). Prolog is a [Logic Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming) which expresses program logic in terms of **relations**. A computation is initiated by running a **query** over these relations.

## Tasks

1. Go to [SWISH Online Prolog Interpreter](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/).
2. Open a new tab and create a program.
3. Copy the code in [family.pl](family.pl) to the new program in the SWISH IDE.
4. Query the **knowledge base** with the example queries.
5. Try to write your own queries.
6. Add the following rules as suggested in the code comments and run some queries:
   1. `grandparent`, `grandfather`, `grandmother`
   2. `uncle`, `aunt`
   3. `couple`, `husband`, `wife`
   4. `predecessor`, `descendant`

## Explore

If your want to explore more, open the list of [example programs](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/example/examples.swinb) from the examples menu of the [SWISH IDE](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/). You may view and study the example code and run a few queries to see what happen. See how the problems are modelled and solved in Prolog.
